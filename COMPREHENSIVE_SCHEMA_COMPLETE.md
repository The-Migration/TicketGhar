## 🐛 **Authentication Issue - RESOLVED**

### **Problem:**
User was getting redirected back to sign-in page after successful login due to schema inconsistencies.

### **Root Cause:**
The system was mixing old schema fields (`firstName`, `lastName`, `username`, `isActive`) with new comprehensive schema fields (`name`, `status`, `role`).

### **Solution:**
1. **Backend**: Updated to use comprehensive schema consistently
2. **Frontend**: All components updated to match comprehensive schema
3. **Authentication**: Email-only login with proper JWT token handling

### **Changes Made:**
- ✅ User Model: Uses `name` instead of `firstName`/`lastName`
- ✅ Registration: Combines `firstName + lastName` → `name`
- ✅ Login: Email-only authentication (no username)
- ✅ User Interface: Updated all components to use comprehensive schema
- ✅ Authentication State: Proper Redux state management
